      <h1>How I Became a WTT National Qualifier Champion</h1>
      <article>

<main>
WTT is a special format in tennis that allows people to play with both men and wormen. It was created by Billie Jean King in an effort
in an effort to have womens and mens tennis shown as equals. It's a great time that allows a player to be able to have a team to root them 
on and give them support through cheering. The format is 2 sets of doulbes (Men and Women), singles (Mens and Womens) and 2 sets of Mixed. How one team wins is 
the culumative games won through all the sets.

         This is my team! We have 7 people on it. 4 guys and 3 girls.Some had brought their partners for a total 11 people came. We made this team in 2021 with the girls being former D1 tennis players and the guys
         being high level rec players. We competed in our league with a gauntlet of National level teams and managed to win our division which qualified us to play a National Qualifier
         tournament. We had 1 year to pick of 6 different locations and we chose Raleigh thinking it would be a mix of fun and good tennis.

         How we won
      </header>
      <main> When we got to Raleigh, we checked into our airbnb and started to get ready by, you know, drinking a beer. We received our schedule, we had 2 matches Friday, and 2 matches Saturday in a round robin of all really high level players.
         We were ready. It was 90+ degrees on court each day. we had a tough first match against a local team. We were playing tight and were losing matches that we shouldn't have lost but luckily one guy was playing amazing. 
         He really cheeered us through and played well which lead to us BARELY winning in OT by 3 games. Our 2nd match was also against former D1 girls and men from Miami.
         I was so nervous but holy hell my team played well. They crushed it and them. We won that match by 15+ games. I was so happy and that finishes the 1st day with us going 2-0.

         The 2nd day, we were EXHAUSTED. We didn't realize how rough that first day was on our bodies. Everyone woke up dragging and our first match of that day was at 11am. Luckily this gave us a bit of time to warm up but not much.
         Again, in our 3rd match, we barely won but 4 games in OT again but it was hot. My team exhausted and our hardest match was still to come. We ran home and tried to cool off in the air conditioning. Some people
         took naps and tried to cool down before we had to go back on court. This match was against a former team who took 2nd in the nation, we didn't know this at the time, and it was tough. Amazingly, our girls swept the competition
         and set us up for victory. It was starting to storm in the back so the tournament director was rushing us. It came down to overtime with a one point all serve going to my partner. Everyone was nervous. She hit an amazing backhand to their girl which set me up for the volley. I hit it. 
         There's thunder in the back from the oncoming rainstorm.<p id="win">IT GOES IN!!</p> Everyone loses it. We are going to nationals.
