WTT is a special format in tennis that allows people to play with both men and wormen. It was created by Billie Jean King in an effort
in an effort to have womens and mens tennis shown as equals. It's a great time that allows a player to be able to have a team to root them 
on and give them support through cheering. The format is 2 sets of doulbes (Men and Women), singles (Mens and Womens) and 2 sets of Mixed.

         This is my team! We have 7 people on it. 4 guys and 3 girls. We made this team in 2021 with the girls being former D1 tennis players and the guys
         being high level rec players. We competed in our league with a gauntlet of National level teams and managed to win our division which qualified us to play a National Qualifier
         tournament. We had 1 year to pick of 6 different locations and we chose Raleigh thinking it would be a mix of fun and good tennis.
